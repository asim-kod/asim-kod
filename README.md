## 🚀 About Me

DevOps & Cloud Engineer with hands-on experience in **AWS cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, Terraform Infrastructure as Code, Kubernetes, and automation**, gained through real-world projects and an intensive 6-month DevOps training program.

I have worked on designing and deploying **scalable, secure, and production-ready cloud infrastructure on AWS**, focusing on automation, reliability, and repeatable deployments. My experience includes building **multi-tier architectures**, automating infrastructure provisioning, and implementing end-to-end **CI/CD pipelines** with minimal manual intervention.

Before transitioning into tech, I spent **5+ years in the animation industry** working with complex production pipelines, cloud render farms, and cross-team collaboration. This background strengthened my **problem-solving mindset, system thinking, and ability to manage real production workflows**, which directly translates into DevOps and cloud engineering practices.
